# takuzu-solver

This javascript was a mini project of mine that shows where to click to solve a takuzu puzzle on the website https://www.puzzle-binairo.com/. To use code, simply paste it into the console once you have a game loaded and it will show the black or white squares if it can solve it (no complex algorithms, only simple).
